## Optimize Your Ad Campaigns with A/B Testing Overview

- **A/B Testing:-** Process of comparing two variants of an ad angainst each other to evaluate which one performs best.
- You create two versions of Ad: `Version A` and `Version B`
- The one performing well will win the test
- Website designers use it often time.

* **A/B Test Best Practice:-**

  - Vary only one variable at a time
  - Example: ` Imagine I'm running a campaign to sell jewelry.`
  - `Version A`: I have this ad with an image of a ring with a blue stone and a copy of my ad says, `"celebrate memorable moments with a special ring. Check out our new spring collection!"` and I have a call to action button that says `Learn More`.
  - - `Version B`: In this case, I'm going to vary only the image. Instead of a blue stone ring, I'm going to show a ring with `three red stones`. I will keep the ad copy the same, and I will also keep the call to Action Button to say, `Learn More`.
  - Why does this matter? `Well, now when I get my results back and I see that ad B won, I'll learn something from my experiment. I'll know that B won, because the image was better at helping me achieve my results. Since everything else in the ad was the same. I know the image was the reason my results were better. Now I know that under these circumstances this image is best, so I can keep this as my optimal image.`

  - Next time Run another A/B Test using the Vesion having better performance from the above test, with different copies.
  - Version A: `"celebrate memorable moments with a special ring. Check out our new spring collection!"` and the call to action is `Learn More`.

  - Version B: `"Celebrate memorable moments with a special ring. Receive 10% off this week!"`, and the call to action is `Learn More`. This win!

- Next time Run another A/B Test using the Vesion having better performance from the above test, with different copies.
- Version A: `"celebrate memorable moments with a special ring. Check out our new spring collection!"` and the call to action is `Learn More`. This win!

- Version B: `"Celebrate memorable moments with a special ring. Receive 10% off this week!"`, and the call to action is `Shop Now`.

- **So in order to get the most out of your A/B tests, test only one variable at a time.**
