# Setting KPIs for Your Marketing

- Let's look at a few examples of KPIs in a marketing setting.
- Let's go back to Calla & Ivy, the flower business you got introduced to in the previous video.
- Remember how Imra wanted to get started selling her bouquets online and how she established a SMART goal to help her kick start that initiative.
- Get `10,000 website visits ` during the month of May.

  - A key performance indicator for Imra will be `number of monthly website visits`. It's measurable. You can quantify the number of website visits. It's directional, can go up or down, visits to the site can increase or decrease over a period of time. And it's directly related to her goal of increasing traffic to her new site.
  - The software Imra uses to manage her website also provides server to dashboard that includes metrics like number of `pages viewed, average time spent per visit and number of transactions`. All of these are interesting metrics and they will lead to the website Imra's marketing activity, `but they're not key to evaluating success for Imra's goal`.
  - The KPI for her to track is `number of monthly website visits`.

  - Let's look at another real life example. `Vodafone` Play is a one stop entertainment destination for Vodafone Telecom subscribers to stream their favorite content, be it live TV, popular shows or movies.
  - In September 2019, Vodaphone kicked off an advertising campaign on Facebook for Vodafone Play. Vodafone wanted to reach a wider audience, an increase its market share for app installs in the increasingly saturated and competitive online streaming market in India. Well, we don't know the exact goal,
  - `Vodafone said. Let's assume it can be formulated as increase app installs by 30% by December 31st in 2019. Vodaphone ran a comprehensive advertising campaign on Facebook using video ads like the one you see here`.

  - **the number of app downloads is an important key to evaluate Vodaphone's campaign success.**

  - Here are a few very common examples of marketing KPIs,
    - **sales revenue** or how much money you generated from sales.
    - **Cost per sale** or how much it costs you in marketing dollars to generate one sale.
    - **Cost per leads** or the cost to get one lead, where a lead could be an email address, for instance, of a potentially interested customer.
    - **Conversion rate** or the number of people that taken action out of a group of people you attracted, for instance to your website. And finally,
    - **brand awareness** or the percentage of people who know about your brand.

- These are just some examples, and we'll encounter them again in this program. Of course, there are many more. When you decide on your KPIs, always ask yourself, how will I know if I've achieved my goal? What indicator or metric will I use for that? Then make sure your KPI is measurable, directional and directly related to your goal.

- Let's see how this works for James at DCB Cleaning. James is planning the social media marketing campaign to help the company with the launch of Snackwall, a service where clients can set up a Snackwall in their offices. Choose the snacks to stock it with and the DCB Cleaning staff will keep the snack supply coming.
- James' SMART goal is `enroll 25% of DCB Cleaning clients in Snackwall within six months`.
- James decides that his KPI will be the **number of people that subscribe to Snackwall**. He can measure that with the information he gets from the DCB Cleaning app dashboard. He can monitor the trend to make sure the numbers keep going up and this metric is directly related to the goal. James can monitor how the number of people that subscribe to Snackwall relates to the total number of clients and that will tell him whether he's reaching his goal of 25%.

- You now know how to set your KPIs related to your SMART goals. Make sure to take your time to reflect on and define your goal in KPIs for any marketing activity you start. It will help to keep you focused and be successful in your marketing efforts.
