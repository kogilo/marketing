## Preparing For Your SMART Goal and KPIs Project

- Your project this week consists of a couple of stages. We encourage you to get started as you move through the material. This week's readings will be the worksheets you need to complete for your project.

- **Step 1: Select a business**
  - Select a business you would like to work on throughout the entire project. You may select a business of choice, or one of the businesses we have created for your use: `Paola Snaps or FocusVu. You can find information on these business below`.
  - As you write your business description, be sure to provide as much detail as possible in the business description for a peer reviewer to be able to assess your content. Don't worry if you aren't sure how much detail to include. You will have an opportunity to edit before submitting.
- Consider the following as you complete your business description:

1. What products or services does the business offer?
2. What type of business model does the business follow (e.g. B2C, B2B, etc)?
3. Is the business brick and mortar, online, or both?
4. Is there any key contextual information that needs to be included here in preparation for completing the remainder of the project (e.g. a new product is being offered)?

Business case studies for use in this week's project:
Case Study A: FocusVu
Alexandra worked as an account manager for a large software firm. A large part of her job consisted of demoing the software tools of her firm. Alexandra often faced technical difficulties with the video conferencing tools she was using. Alexandra shared her frustrations with her former roommate, Janelle, an engineer, and they decided there should be an easier way. FocusVu was born. FocusVu provides private, secure video conferencing software especially designed for product demos. You can preload your demo, test it out ahead of time, prepare your meeting and then invite anyone using a unique, single use link. Alexandra and Janelle left their jobs, settled in Boulder, CO, accepted VC investments and quickly grew the company and its client base.

Recently, FocusVu has been developing a new classroom feature and is getting ready for a feature launch, including developing a training schedule and content.

Case Study B: Paola Snaps
Paola started her business in 2013, soon after her daughter was born. Having worked with a photographer for a while, Paola wanted to apply her headshot expertise to child photography. Her focus on candid pictures that bring out a personality left her feeling a bit underwhelmed with the school pictures her sister showed her. Paola felt that she could bring something new and different to the industry, something less focused on studio perfect and more focused on the child. So, she decided to take a leap of faith and create her own business, Paola Snaps, so she could bring her photography style to people who wanted real, candid, and modern photography of people and events most precious to them. Paola wanted to combine her aesthetic with business photography services creating a unique modern twist.

Paola has recently been hired for some weddings and has found success with wedding photography. She is considering focusing on weddings as a new line of business.
