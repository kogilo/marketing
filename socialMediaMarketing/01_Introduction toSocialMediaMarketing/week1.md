- There are **two** core elements that typically defined social media platforms.

  - They let people

  1. **connect**
  2. **create or share content**.

- There are different types of social networks. Some are more focused on connecting, and others on content creation.
- Some target broad audiences and some are more focused on niches or interest groups.

- Fred Cavazza divided up the landscape in few categories. In this overview, he categorizes the social media platforms in:

![SocailMediaLandscape](SocailMediaLandscape.png)

- Social media marketing is often split in **two different categories**
  1. Organic or free social media marketing and
  2. Paid social media marketing, also called social media advertising.

1. Organic or free social media marketing
   - refers to all social media activity that businesses can engage in without paying a fee. It's an important part of marketing as social media users have come to expect that their favorite brands, or the businesses they interact with are present on social media.
   - it involves
     - **Establish business profile** or a business presence in the social media channels that matter to users.
     - For instance, setting up a Facebook business page, or an Instagram account for business.
     - **Engaging with users on social media to post** tweets, comments, sharing and so on.
     - **Connecting with customers through messaging** platforms like WhatsApp, for instance, often used for more individual customer service.
2. Paid social media marketing, also called social media advertising.

   - refers to promoting a business' presence or message through:

     - **advertising on social media platforms**. That could be ads on Facebook, or promoted tweets on Twitter, or promoted posts on Instagram and so on.

   - Organic and paid social media marketing go hand in hand. Having a solid, organic social media presence matters to the success of your social media advertising. Ads, on the other hand, can strengthen your organic presence.

- let's look at an example of organic versus paid social marketing first. - Let's take **Staples**, an office supply chain.
- Here is their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/staples), in which they regularly post about new products, provide useful tips and so on. They also have a presence on [Instagram](). Here are a few of their posts, and you can find them on Twitter too.
- Staples posts on these accounts all fall on the organic social media marketing. They don't have to pay to create these pages or these posts, and it's a way for them to interact with their customers and prospects.

- But Staples also uses advertising on social media platforms to reach a broader audience. Here are two examples of ads they ran on Facebook and Instagram. As opposed to their organic social media marketing, these are posts that they did pay for. Social media marketing, let businesses connect with customers and prospects, and it's an excellent way for businesses to share content with their audience. They can do this, through both organic, and paid marketing. In what follows, we'll look at how business participation in social media really works.

## Social Media and Business

- Today more than 140 million businesses use Facebook products every month to find new customers, hire employees, or engage with their communities.
- Companies use social media to learn from their audiences, build loyalty, promote their products, and provide customer service.

- But in order to be successful, businesses have to remember the **two core** aspects of social media.

- Social media lets people **connect** and share or \*_create content_. Participating in social media requires attention to both of these aspects.
- And people have come to expect this connection to businesses and their products and brands.
- companies need connections to their markets to create long-term loyalty.
- To be successful in building a social presence, companies need to understand what type of engagement is prevalent on a given platform, and engage with users in those unique ways.
- To do that, it's a good idea for businesses to take some time to observe and understand the platform and its users, then a business can authentically participate.
- Participation means creating value for your audience, by providing meaningful contributions, you'll be able to expand your following.

- As social media platforms have matured, they've created both free and paid tools for businesses and marketers to reach and engage their audiences. For example, Facebook.com has created dedicated pages for businesses. Facebook business pages enable businesses to have a unique presence online, where they can engage with their audience through posting content, as Facebook feed posts and stories.

- Users on Facebook can engage with businesses through comments, reactions, one-on-one chat through Messenger, and they can share content from businesses with their friends.

- Advertising on social media can help companies to extend the reach of their message, increase traffic to their site, and drive sales. Let's take a look at an ad by Tuft and Needle, an innovative mattress company that has had success with ads on YouTube.

## Social Media and Non-Profits

- You're probably familiar with the ice bucket challenge, the viral campaign from 2014 that had everyone from your neighbor to Arnold Schwarzenegger dumping buckets of ice water over their heads to raise money for ALS research and other charities
- It started with three friends who wanted to cure a debilitating disease. When Pete Frates was diagnosed with ALS, he and his friends wanted to fight a diagnosis and raise money for ALS research. So they turned to Facebook to amplify their reach and get their story out to the world and it worked.
- Ice bucket challenge inspired the 1st generation of Facebook fund raising tools. To date there are 2.4 million ice bucket challenge videos tagged on Facebook and movement continues to raise money today.
- Non-profits like businesses are able to create Facebook pages, events, use Messenger and groups. As well as Instagram accounts for free to connect and engage with their communities.

- Let's take a look at some of these specialized tools. With Facebook's charitable giving tools, non-profits can raise money and awareness for their cause on Facebook an Instagram. These free tools help non-profits collect donations and enable supporters to fundraise for a non-profit. Non-profits using Facebook's payment platform to process donations paying no fee, so 100% of the donations go to the charity. Facebook is not alone in offering special tools and services for non-profits, YouTube's non-profit program for instance, helps non-profits connect with supporters, volunteers and donors. For many causes, video is a new but essential format for storytelling. With one billion viewers on YouTube every month, non-profits of all sizes can use YouTube videos to share their stories and reach a global audience, drive empathy and engage supporters. For example, as part of the YouTube non-profit program, non-profits can set up fundraisers with tools that viewers can use to make donations to an organization or cause right from a video on YouTube. Here is an example of a fundraiser set up by Smosh Games together with St. Judes Children's Hospital to raise money for free care for children and families in need.

- So non-profits have really cracked a code on engaging audiences and turning them into donors through the use of social networks. Let's look at this example from the WWF. They use Snapchat to share pictures of endangered animals, images shared on Snapchat disappeared after they've been viewed, and the WWF cleverly accompanied their image with this hashtag. #lastselfie, they suggested to Snapchat users that they should take a screenshot of the images and share them, so this would not be the animals last selfie. Users share their screenshots on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and so on. Adding viral strength to this campaign, an raising awareness for the WWF's effort to protect endangered species among the millennial audience. Let's look at a short video about the campaign

- Finally, I would like to mention two organisations that have created tools that help people to tap into the power of social networks to help their cause. One of them is GoFundMe, a platform where people can create a web page for their own fundraiser. They can share this with friends through integrations with social networks like Facebook and Twitter for instance, raising awareness and donations for their cause. Petition website Change.org is another platform that uses the power of social networks to rally people behind causes. Users and organisations can create petitions on the sites that they can share through their social networks. As you can see, social media can be a very powerful channel for non-profits.

- Marketing for non-profits isn't different from marketing in businesses. Marketers work on understanding their audience, creating a powerful message, put that message in front of their audience and then measure and optimize the impact.

# Categorizing Social Media

- Here's an overview of the most used social media platforms globally as compiled by Hootsuite and We Are Social, a social marketing agency.
  ![Categorizing Social Media](CategorizingSocialMedia.png)

- Facebook is by far the largest network with over 2.4 billion users worldwide, it's followed by YouTube.
- WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both owned by Facebook are the largest messaging focused platforms.
- The Chinese platform WeChat closes out the top five. It started as a messaging platform, but now offers a lot more than just chat.
- Instagram, also part of the Facebook family, is another big platform with over a billion users.
- Tik Tok, a very fast growing video based network known as Douyin in China follows. QQ QZONE and Sina are primarily used in China.
- The conversation platform Reddit follows, and then Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest and finally Chinese video sharing platform, Kuaishou.

- Aside from the size of the audience of these different networks, it's important for marketers to consider the demographics of the people that use these platforms. Understanding the demographics of the users of the different networks will help marketers choose the social media where most of their customers are active.

- To give you an idea, I've mapped the age and gender distribution for some of the most popular networks for the US. Based on a study from the Pew Research Center.

#### Demographic

- you could categorize the different social media platforms by their specific focus. For instance, some focus on publishing, others on sharing, messaging, discussing and collaborating or networking. You could also categorize social media based on the specific audiences and interests they tailor to. Niche platforms like Behance for instance focus on bringing artists together. A platform like Twitch is focused on gamers and Houzz on architects and designers or people who are building or improving their house. Niche groups like these can be very attractive to marketers depending on the product or service they sell.

- But there are few platforms that you will need to understand as a social media marketer today. In what follows, we will give you an overview of the most important social media platforms, who their users are, and what they use them for. And will also look at the opportunities they offer for marketers.

## The History of Facebook

- Found in 2004 by `Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz` and `Chris Hughes` while they were students at Harvard.
- Mark and his friends wanted to create an online directory that will bring all of these Facebooks together.
- They called it a site with the intention to connect students all over the university and they called their directory, **Thefacebook**.
- Usage grew exponentially and long-lost connections were found, updates shared, and friendships rekindled.

- The core functionality of Facebook in the early days was exactly as it is now. You create a profile on the site and you find people to connect with and share updates with. But since then, Facebook has added a lot of features and new ways for people to interact

- Four years after its launch in 2004, Facebook launched its first mobile app for iOS.
- Later in 2008, Facebook introduced Facebook Messenger, an app to let people directly connect to each other to chat.
- Then in 2012, Facebook acquired photo-sharing app, Instagram. While Facebook already offered its users the ability to share photos, with the acquisition of Instagram, they added sharing of mobile photos.
- At the time of the acquisition, Facebook vouched to keep and build on Instagram strengths rather than integrating the functionality into Facebook, hence Facebook and Instagram have remained separate apps, each serving their specific audience.
- A few years later, in early 2014, Facebook announced it had bought a popular global cross-platform mobile messaging app, WhatsApp. WhatsApp's easy functionality would make it possible for more people to connect, an essential part of the Facebook mission.
- Shortly after, Facebook acquired Oculus VR, which at the time was the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and the seller of the Oculus Rift headsets that transport people into virtual reality. Using the headset, people can immerse themselves in a different reality and connect with others mostly for the purpose of playing games. At the time, Mark Zuckerberg in a press release said "Mobile is the platform of today and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow. Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever and change the way we work, play and communicate." This quote is helpful to understand the vision behind the focus on virtual reality.

- In 2019, Novi was introduced. Novi is a digital wallet created by Facebook that lets people send and hold Libra, a digital currency. Novi is new, but according to the press release from Facebook, it's meant to make sending money as easy as sending a message.

# Facebook Products Overview

- But now, let's look at these product through a marketing lens.
- By the end of this video, you will know how to distinguish between the different advertising opportunities that exist among the Facebook apps and services.
- **Ads** are part of the experience in Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
- For businesses, these ads are **great opportunities for growth**. And aside from Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, Facebook also offers a product called `Audience Network` which offers businesses yet another way to connect to their users.
- Let's take a look at how each of these products can help a business.
- **Facebook** is the most widely used of the different Facebook apps and services. Businesses and people use Facebook to make meaningful connections and share. Just like people, businesses can create a free page to establish their company's presence and start interacting. Facebook offers businesses different ways to grow, some paid and some free.
- For example, businesses can **share posts or stories**. They can **message customers**, **promote events**, **sell products**, **accept appointment bookings** or **post jobs**.
- They can also **promote content** through **paid advertisements**.
- People come to **Instagram** to be **inspired and discover** things they care about, including content from brands and businesses. With Instagram, businesses can grow their brand for **free by sharing photos and videos and exchanging direct messages with people**. Plus, they can **extend their brands' reach in awareness with paid advertising**. Instagram is a visual platform to explore and interact with people looking to connect with businesses. Businesses can interact with people through messages and comments on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.
- **Messenger** lets businesses instantly connect with people on their Facebook page or the Messenger app and make conversations happen in real time. Businesses can use Messenger to make suggestions, assist with sales and offer support in one continuous conversation. They can also create ads with an integration that let's people click to Messenger to start conversations with potential customers or create sponsored messages to connect with people. While businesses can advertise to people on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, there's one more way in which businesses can use Facebook to grow and that's true to Facebook Audience Network. While people spend a lot of their time on Facebook's platforms, they're also spending time in other apps.
- Audience Network is a collection of apps and websites that Facebook partners with to allow advertisers to extend their Facebook and Instagram advertisements across the Internet.
- We will learn how to advertise on Facebook's platforms later, but for now, it's good to know that you can advertise on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, but also on a collection of apps and websites that are not owned by Facebook. This allows advertisers to reach a wider network of people and placements.

- Businesses can deliver the same ads they create for their Facebook campaign through the Audience Network and it will automatically adapt to fit the app or website where it appears. For businesses who want to grow and connect to their audience, these Facebook apps and services are very powerful. The tools you can use to access these platforms as a business are all connected, making it possible to create content on one platform and deliver it across the other apps. For example, you can create one advertising campaign that will deliver ads to Facebook, Instagram Messenger and the Audience Network. You learn in this program how to do that in Facebook's ads manager. You now have a better understanding of the different products Facebook offers and the apps and services businesses can use to grow. Now it's time to look at the main social platforms in a bit more detail. We'll start with Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and then we'll cover other platforms outside the Facebook family.
