    - In addition to posts from your friends, you could also see updates from people you find interesting but don't know personally like journalists or celebrities on your news feed.

    - While you can't directly add them as a friend, you can do this by following them. Well known public figures with large followings are verified by Facebook and they have a blue badge next to their name to help you know that they really are who they claim to be.

    - Connect with other people by joining groups on Facebook. Groups are a place to communicate about shared interests with certain people. You can create a group for anything, your family reunion, your after work sports team, or your book club. When you join a group, posts from that group will start appearing in your news feed as well.
    - As you can see, Facebook makes it easy for people to not only stay connected with their loved ones, but also stay up-to-date with things and issues that interest them, which can include a business. When businesses use Facebook, instead of a profile, they can create a Facebook page.
    - It's where people can connect with the business to learn more about its products or services.

    - Similarly to a profile, when you set up a page on Facebook, you can add information about your business. You can add a cover photo and profile picture that best represents your business. You can also provide contact information like your website, your address, your phone number and business hours. Just as you can post updates on your profile, businesses can also share posts on their page. People come to business pages looking to learn more about the business and its products, hear about latest news and promotions. So it's important for businesses to post on a regular basis

      1. story posts,
      2. video posts and
