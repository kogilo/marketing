# What is a Customer Journey and Why Do You Need One?

- An important part of a social media marketer's job is to come up with powerful messages that can help make people buy a product or service, and put that message in front of the target customer at the right time.

- How do you do that?

- A customer, or a buyer journey refers to the process a user goes through when purchasing a product. The customer journey is split in **five stages**.

  - First, there's the **awareness stage**, or the point where the customer first hears about or becomes aware of the product or service.
  - Then, there's the **interest stage**, which is where the customer becomes interested in what you have to offer.
  - A third stage in the customer journey is **the desire stage**, or the point at which the customer would really like to have your product or service.

  - Then, comes the **conversion stage**, which is where the customer takes action and buys your product or service. We refer to that in marketing as a conversion. In other words, it's the stage where a person converts to becoming a buyer.
  - Finally, there's the **advocacy stage**, which is the stage where people become advocates of the products or service they bought.

- Let's look back at my bike purchase.

  - I first became aware of the PUBLIC bikes when I visited our local bike store.
  - Then, after I saw the article about PUBLIC bikes, and went to do a little bit more research, I became interested.
  - As I saw the posts from my friends and the cool pictures on Instagram and Facebook, I actually wanted the bike. I was in the desire stage.
  - When I then saw the promotion my local bike store had over the holidays, I finally took action and converted.
  - After riding my bike for a little bit, I loved the experience and I became an advocate.

  - => So I went from being content with my old bike to an advocate for my PUBLIC bike. That was my customer or buyer's journey. I went through all five stages and was, of course, suddenly pushed by marketing to advance through my journey.

  - The customer journey is not always equally explicit or linear. In some cases, people may jump a stage, or they may go back and forth a bit through the different stages. For instance, some people may desire a product at some stage and then lose interest after a little bit, but with the right marketing messages, they may become interested again and desire the product and even buy it.

- Even with that in mind, it's a good idea for a marketer to **map their customer journey** as they plan out their marketing. Marketing is all about moving people through the customer journey. At every stage of the journey, you want to get a message in front of the people in that stage to persuade them to move on to the next stage.
- Depending on the stage a person is in, different types of messages will work better than others.
- First, you have to generate **awareness** for your product and get people interested. Ads that show your product and brand and the associated benefits are typical for that stage. In my bike example, this could simply be an ad or an image of the bike showing its beautiful design and some of its key features.
- Then, to move people from being **interested to desiring a product**, as that bring to life how a product may fit in a person's life, what outcomes they can expect and so on will help. In my bike example, that could be Instagram posts of people **grocery shopping** in the city on their bikes, for instance. They are the types of messages that help people imagine themselves with the product.
- Then, to move someone from the **desire to the conversion stage**, marketing or advertising that helps people make the jump to action helps. Promotions are typical way to do that. It could be a **coupon, a sale, or maybe a gift** that comes with the purchase. For my bike, it was a seasonal sale that made me decide to buy. You might think that the task of the marketer is done once people buy the product, but that's not actually true. Once someone has bought a product, it's important to **turn that person into an advocate**. That may guarantee more sales down the line and it could help to generate some **word of mouth marketing**, one of the most valuable forms of marketing, where your message gets spread by happy customers.
- How could you help at this stage? Great after-sale service can help. Make it easy for people to start using your product, or contact you with any questions they may have. Encouragement for people to review your product or post about a product on social media can also help. The process of moving people through the customer journey results in what marketers refer to as a marketing funnel.
- The funnel symbolizes the fact that not all customers at a certain stage will move on to the next stage. In fact, gradually, more and more potential customers will drop out.

- Not all the people that are aware of your product will also be interested, and not everyone who's interested will really desire your product. Of the people that would really like your product, not everyone ends up buying, and the people that buy don't all become advocates. Of course, marketers will try hard to minimize the drop-off at every stage, but funnels are a good representation of marketing reality.

- Understanding your customer's journey will help you craft your messages and reach your customers at the right time to help them move along their journey.
