# Set Your Campaign Budget

### Determine Your Campaign Budget

- **Campaign Budget:-** The total amount you plan to spend over the course of your ad campaign.
- The total amount you plan to spend per day or per months of the campaign life.
- Sometime you may present with the fixed budget
- Sometime you may recommend the budget for campaign

#### Questions to Guide Your Campaign Budgeting:-

- What is the result you're aiming to achieve?
- How much will it cost to drive a result?
- Let use the following example:

- **Goal:-** $50,000 in revenue per month

  - 1 in 100 visitors become buyers
  - Each buyer spends $200
  - $50,000/$200 = 250 buyers needed.

- 250 buyers X 100 = 25,000 website visitors to make $50,000.
-

- **Goal** Get 25,000 visitors
  - eg 2 pair of Tiyer:
  - Cost: $80 + $20 = $100
  - Revenue : $200
  - Profit: $200 - $100 = $100
  - advertising spend < $100

* Revenue: $50,000
* Profit: $25,000
* Ad spend < $ 25,000
* Actual profit = $25,000 - Ad spend

* **Don't spend more on advertising than the profit you make.** during the fixed period

## Rule of Thirds:

- Maximum Campaign Budget = Revenue / 3
- $50,000 / 3 = $16,600

### Test Your Ad Campaign:

- Sart with a small test budget
- Monitor your campaign closely
- Calculate how much you can spend to reach your objectives.

### Question

- Let’s say you’re trying to achieve a marketing goal for app downloads.

- You want 20,000 people to download the app, which costs $1. You make $0.50 in profits per download.

- What’s the maximum amount you can spend on advertising without losing money?

## Soln

- Cost = $20,000
- Profit = $10,000
- Revenue = Cost + Profit = $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000

- Maximum Campaign Budget = Revenue / 3
- $30,000 / 3 = $10,000
