`Imra always loved flowers, and as a child would pick them on hikes with her parents an braid them into crowns. But after graduating art school with a degree in design, she was disappointed to see the same bland kind of bouquets being made without any kind of artistic passion or unique design to them. So in 2010, Imra began her own flower shop called Calla & Ivy. In order to offer the unique handcrafted design forward bouquets she knew could bring joy and inspiration to people around her. After a short time, Imra's shop became so popular that she expanded her presence online where customers can order her bouquets digitally and also subscribe for regular flower deliveries. And while her store still exists, Imra uses it to experiment with new ideas. The majority of her sales come from her website.`
