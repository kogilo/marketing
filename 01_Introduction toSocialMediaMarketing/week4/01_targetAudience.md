# What Is a Target Audience and Why Do You Need One?

- ` management consultant and author Peter Drucker. He said "the aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself."`

- **A target audience** is the group of people you want to reach with your marketing message, because they may be likely to take action as a result of seeing it.

- Not everyone is interested in every product.

- People in your target audience will have certain characteristics in common.
- These characteristics usually fall into `three broad categories.`

- First **demographics**, they may have the same age, gender, household, income, occupation, education, and location.

- People in your target audience may also be described based on **interests** they share.
- They may all be interested in certain products, topics, or activities.
- Or they may share certain **behaviors**. Maybe they read the same publications, visit the same online destinations, have certain hobbies, or play the same sports.

- Identifying and describing your target audience based on these characteristics will help you develop your marketing.

- **A primary target audience** will typically get to most attention, since the people in this group are expected to become your most valuable group of customers.
- **Secondary target audiences** are other groups of people with common characteristics who may be interested in your products or services, but are unlikely to become your most valuable customers. Secondary target audiences can help you structure your marketing efforts. Especially, if you sell more than one product, or service, or if you feel your products or services may appeal to distinctly different groups of people.

- Let's take another look at Calla & Ivy, the flower business:-
  - Imr is setting up the website for the business so she can sell her flower bouquets online.
  - She has planned some marketing for the website.
  - And in order to spend her money wisely, she wants to target people who are most likely to buy her flowers online.
  - Based on her experience with the customers in her flower shop in Amsterdam, she decided to define her `primary target audience` as follows.
  - `Women between the ages of 30 and 55` who live in urban areas have some higher education and who are interested in interior design.
  - But she's also learned over the years that men visit her store to buy flowers for special occasions, birthdays, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, etc. Or sometimes just to surprise a loved one.
  - So she decided that it would be good to define a `secondary target audience` that she would direct her `special occasion and gift giving campaigns` to. She describes this target as `professional men `between `35 and 65`, who live in urban areas, and who commonly give gifts.
  - Having these specific targets in mind helps in Imra think about her marketing.
