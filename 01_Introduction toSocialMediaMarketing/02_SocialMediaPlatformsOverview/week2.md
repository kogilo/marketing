    - When you share a post, it may appear on your friends news feed, a rolling list of updates that people see when they first log on to Facebook.

    - Similarly, after you added friends on Facebook, you'll also be able to see their updates on your news feed. Stories appear above the news feed of the people you decide to share your story with, as well as in their, Messenger inbox. When you see a post from a friend on your news feed, you get engaged with it in a few different ways. You can like the post by just clicking Like or express a more specific reaction to it such as love or laugh, sad or angry.

    - When you see a post from a friend on your news feed, you get engaged with it in a few different ways. You can like the post by just clicking Like or express a more specific reaction to it such as love or laugh, sad or angry. You can leave a comment in the form of words, photos and videos or even GIFS to share a response. If you want your friends to see the post, you can also share the post on your own profile by clicking Share.
    - In addition to posts from your friends, you could also see updates from people you find interesting but don't know personally like journalists or celebrities on your news feed.

    - While you can't directly add them as a friend, you can do this by following them. Well known public figures with large followings are verified by Facebook and they have a blue badge next to their name to help you know that they really are who they claim to be.

    - Connect with other people by joining groups on Facebook. Groups are a place to communicate about shared interests with certain people. You can create a group for anything, your family reunion, your after work sports team, or your book club. When you join a group, posts from that group will start appearing in your news feed as well.
    - As you can see, Facebook makes it easy for people to not only stay connected with their loved ones, but also stay up-to-date with things and issues that interest them, which can include a business. When businesses use Facebook, instead of a profile, they can create a Facebook page.
    - It's where people can connect with the business to learn more about its products or services.

    - Similarly to a profile, when you set up a page on Facebook, you can add information about your business. You can add a cover photo and profile picture that best represents your business. You can also provide contact information like your website, your address, your phone number and business hours. Just as you can post updates on your profile, businesses can also share posts on their page. People come to business pages looking to learn more about the business and its products, hear about latest news and promotions. So it's important for businesses to post on a regular basis

    - Many businesses build a presence on Facebook to tell their business's story. There are a variety of visual formats available to help you with that.
    - Here are `three` different types of posts you can create on a business page:
      1. story posts,
      2. video posts and
      3. photo posts.
      - These different post types help to capture attention and prompt action.
        Let's take a look at how stationery company Ink Meets Paper uses their page to communicate with their customers. - They've chosen a profile picture that represents their business and an appealing cover photo that features one of their products.

- Running an ad directly from your page is the easiest way to start advertising and find more people who might be interested in what your business has to offer. This is called boosting a post. Boosted posts to do exactly what their name suggests.
- You can boost a post you already made on your page so more people see it.
- Beyond boosted posts, you can also use a tool called Facebook ads manager. You can think of ads manager as a one stop shop for all things advertising with Facebook.

- When you go to [YouTube](www.youtube.com) or the YouTube app on your mobile device you can start watching right away.
- If you want to `comment`, `share`, or `save videos`, or `follow other people's channels` you need to `log in with your Google ID`.
- If you want to `upload videos`, you'll need to `create a channel`.
- You can create a channel under your `name`, or you can choose a `brand` or `company name`.
- Once you have a channel, you can choose to make it `public so people` can subscribe to it and it can come up in `search`.
- If someone subscribes to your channel, your channel will appear on `their YouTube homepage`.
- Creating and managing your channels happens in `YouTube Studio`.

  - Here you can `edit your videos`, `sort them into playlists` or `groups of videos` that you think work together, `read and answer comments`, and `get insights` on the performance of your videos and `growth of your audience`.
  - Creators on YouTube who run the `gamut` from people saving a few individual videos to professional creators like Dude Perfect, or more traditional media publishers like CNN.
  - Since anyone with a phone or computer can be a creator on the platform, YouTube has given rise to a whole new group of `celebrities`, the YouTube stars phenomenon.
  - `YouTube stars` are people who've built their fame through `broadcasting themselves` on YouTube. Stars like Rick Garman, David Dobrik, and Jenna Marbles have very large and loyal followings, mostly made up of young fans. Their authentic style and low-key production make them quite different from celebrities in the traditional media.

- These YouTube creators monetize their channels by sharing and the revenue from ads on their channel, or from sponsorships and payments they receive from businesses who want them to plug their products.

- YouTube also offers a `live TV service` in the US called YouTube TV where people can stream over `70 TV channels`. There's also `YouTube Music`, a music streaming service, and `YouTube Premium` which gives users an advertising-free YouTube experience and the option to download videos.

## How businesses use YouTube.

- First, by `building a presence`. Businesses and brands can participate in the same way people can create their scan.
- A business can create a `channel` with content to engage its audience.
- Many brands create content on the platform from `helpful tips` and `how-tos` to behind-the-scenes content of `how products are made`.
- Marketers think about `contents that may engage their customers` and use YouTube as a way to distribute that content and engage people deeper into `what the brand has to offer`.
- Example L'Oréal channel. It's full of helpful tutorials, videos about products and so on, and L'Oréal organized it's playlist in the channel around different product lines and events.
- Educational videos and tutorials are popular among YouTube users and many brands rely on them to engage their audience.
- Second, marketers use YouTube for `advertising`. YouTube offers many attractive advertising options.
- Given the high number of people on the platform, YouTube is an attractive medium for marketers to find their audience.
- `Ad` types on YouTube include `skippable video ads` that appear before the main video, or short `six-second video ads that cannot be skipped` and that are often used specifically for `mobile devices`, and `ads` among `YouTube search `results on the YouTube homepage and alongside related videos.
- One other way in which marketers engage on YouTube is through the use of `influencers`. YouTube stars have a `loyal audience` and they often cater to a `younger demographic`. That audience is attractive to marketers and they'll often partner with these YouTubers who have a lot of influence over their fans.
- Marketers will `carefully select the influencers` they work with based on the demographics of their followers and the nature of their content, their personality, and their communication style. While working with influencers is certainly not limited to YouTube, the rise of the YouTube stars has made YouTube one of the most important ways to get a message out through influencers with a large fan base.
- With over two billion users globally, it's an attractive place for marketers and one that features in many social media marketing campaigns.
