## What are KPIs and Why Do you Need them?

- Assume you have the following goal

  - `By the end of this year, I want to run the Honolulu Marathon in under 4 hours`.
  - That's a `SMART goal`.
  - In other words, it specific, it's measurable. You know you want to run 26.2 miles in under four hours. It's achievable, if you train of course. It's relevant since it's a goal that relates to your plan to get very fit and it's time-bound. You have until December to get ready since that's when the Honolulu Marathon is scheduled.

- Say you plan to train for this using `Strava`, an app that helps you track your running progress.
- Here's a report you get for one of your practice runs on Strava. It gives you:-
  - the distance you ran,
  - the time it took you,
  - your pace. Y
  - data on elevation gain and
  - calories burned.
- All of this information is interesting, but the most important information here is pace.
- You see that you're running at a pace of 11 minutes and 49 seconds per mile. If you want to complete a marathon in under 4 hours, you'll need to run at approximately 9 minutes per mile, so you have a little bit of training to do.
- **Pace** is a key metric for you to track to assess whether you're making progress towards your goal. All the other data available is interesting and it's related to your goal, but **not as crucial as pace** when it comes to achieving your goal.
- In this case, you can call `pace a key performance indicator` or `KPI`.
- KPIs are measurable values that can help you track your progress towards your goal. KPIs are usually `quantitative, meaning they can be measured`. They are `directional`, they `go up or down`. And they have a direct relationship to your goal. For marketers, KPIs are an important tool to help identify the metrics that really matter and distinguish them from the data that are interesting. But that `don't necessarily tell you whether or not you're achieving` your goal.

- Throughout this program, it will become clear that a lot of data is available to digital or social media marketers. All activity online generates a data trail and the amount of data can quickly become overwhelming. KPIs are helpful to prevent it. And if you set your KPIs related to your goal ahead of time, you will protect yourself from getting lost in the data. KPIs are a tool to help you evaluate the success of your marketing.
