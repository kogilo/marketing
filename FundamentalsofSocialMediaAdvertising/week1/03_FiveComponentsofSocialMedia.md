## Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Ad

- First, the message you communicate has to be right for the `target audience`.
- Then the `image` you select has to match your `copy`.
- There should be `clear call to action` that expresses what you want your target audience to do next.
- Then the ad and the call-to-action should match what people will find on the `landing page`.

* **Example**: Cala & Ivy

- `targeted` to design conscious `women between the ages of 30 and 44, who have a need to beautify their home`.
- `copy` reads, `"Bring the spring colors into your home."` Well, that should be appealing to women who want to add some beauty to the home interior.
- The `image` shows a `beautiful spring bouquet` which reflects exactly what the text promises.
- There's a `call-to-action`, CTA in the form of a button that says, `"Shop Now."` .
- When you click, it brings you to this `landing page` here that shows the exact bouquet from the add and you can buy right from this page.
