## Creating Effective Ads on Social Media

### How Your Business Goals Determine Your KPIs

- Your campaign objective => `Metrics used to evaluate success (KPIs)`
- **Example:**
- **Objective:** Brand awareness => **KPI:** Ad recall lift.
- **Objective:** Website traffic => **KPI:** Number of website visits, cost per visit.
- **Objective:** Sales/Conversions => **KPI:** Number of purchases, ROAS.
- **Return on Ad Spend(ROAS)=** Campaign Revenue/Ad Spend
  Ad Spend = $5,000
  Revenue = $15,000

  => $15,000/$5,000 = 3x
  => **ROAS is 3x**

- **Objective:** Leads(signup for newsletter) => **KPI:** Number of leads, Cost per Lead, ROAS.
  Ad Spend = $2,000
  Number of leads = 400

  Number of leads x Lead of buyer
  conversion rate = Number of buyers

  Assume:

  Lead to buyer conversion rate = 20%

  400 leads x 20% = 80 buyers

  **Number of buyers: 80**
  Average sales per buyer: $100

  80 x $100 = $8,000

  **Revenue is $8,000**

Campaign Revenue/Ad Spend = Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

    Revenue = $80,000
    Ad Spend = $2,000

    $8,000/$2,000 = 4x

**ROAS is 4x**
